Intorduction to Java

This repository emphasizes basic concepts of Input/Output, Data Types, Variables and Arrays through the context of solving problems. Elementary programming skills, such as conditional and loops execution were an extereme focus at the later stages of the program. 

Much of the code placed in this repository is based on the labs
